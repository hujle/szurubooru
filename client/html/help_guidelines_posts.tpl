<p>Thank you for taking the time to contribute to <%- ctx.name %>. While we welcome 
both new and old content, there are specific standards and guidelines that your 
uploads must follow to ensure high quality.</p>

<p>While most uploads are accepted, posts not meeting quality expectations may be 
subject to removal at the discretion of the administrators. Criteria for quality 
expectations can be gleaned by perusing the Yumebooru. Posts falling short of these 
expectations may include sexually explicit content, extremely low resolution, or 
heavily compressed content. However, exceptions can be made if a higher quality 
version is attainable through reverse image search engines like Yandex, Google , 
SauceNAO, IQDB, etc.</p>

<p>The upload rules (see below) go into detail on what is considered risky content.</p>

<p class='section'><strong>READ THE <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/help/guidelines/upload_rules">UPLOAD RULES</a> BEFORE PROCEEDING!</strong></p>

<p class='section'><strong>Uploading</strong></p>

<p>To upload a post, either paste the image from clipboard or link onto the upload 
page, or select the file directly from your computer.<br>You can also upload a post 
to <%- ctx.name %> straight from the source website using <a href="https://github.com/neobooru/SzuruChrome">SzuruChrome browser extension</a>. 
It is also more convenient because the source link is attached to the post 
automatically, and you can add all the tags right before uploading. This extension 
is available for all Firefox- and Chromium-based web browsers. However, it doesn't 
work with all websites. You can find the list of supported websites <a href="https://github.com/neobooru/neo-scraper/blob/master/README.md">here</a>. 
Although the configuration is quite simple, make sure to disable automatic tag 
import from supported pages and enable uploading as content and automatic search for 
similar posts. If you have any questions left about uploading to <%- ctx.name %> – 
feel free to contact us through the contacts on our about page.<br>Please refrain 
from uploading content from sources other than the original artist. Always strive to 
find and credit the original source whenever feasible. Avoid using platforms like 
4chan, Reddit, or Facebook as content sources, unless the artist has personally
shared their work there or has since removed the original post.</p>

<p class='section'><strong>Source your upload</strong></p>

<p>Sourcing uploads plays a crucial role on <%- ctx.name %>, serving both archival 
and tracking needs. It&rsquo;s a simple task and in the case of uploads from the 
internet, will even save you a step. The source of an image can also provide 
information about whether it is an image sample, or has a bad id.<br>
<strong>Sourcing is NOT optional if your upload is not self-provided. Source your 
uploads as best as you can.</strong></p>

<p class='section'><strong>Minimal tagging criteria</strong></p>

<p>Tagging criteria on <%- ctx.name %> is a lot simpler than it is on other booru-like 
websites, and includes the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Character must be identified by name in the tags. Place a <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/character_request">character_request</a> 
    tag if you aren&rsquo;t sure where a character comes from.</li>
    <li>Artist must be credited. Uploads must have at least an artist tag.</li>
    <li>Copyrights which a character is from must be identified.</li>
    <li>If you are not sure if an image is tagged completely, always place a 
<a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/tagme">tagme</a> tag, and another contributor 
will review your tags, adding and making connections as necessary.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>For tagging guidelines in greater detail, please see <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/help/guidelines/tags">
How to: Tag</a> page.</p>

<p class='section'><strong>Check for duplicates</strong></p>

<p>Be sure that your post has not been uploaded by someone else. When uploading an 
image, make sure that “Skip duplicates” is unchecked. This will allow Yumebooru to 
automatically detect the duplicates.<br>Bigger size doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean 
better quality, unless the filesizes vastly differ. For example, if one image is 800 
kb, and another is 840 kb, it&rsquo;s very likely they&rsquo;ll be duplicates. 
Always check the images closely before continuing upload if you&rsquo;re unsure.</p>
