<p>Tagging is essential for organizing and navigating <%- ctx.name %>. Proper 
tagging helps users find specific artworks, recognize artists, locate particular 
characters, and explore related themes. A well-tagged image ensures that it can 
be discovered by those who are interested in specific elements of the content 
uploaded to the board. By following these guidelines, you help keep <%- ctx.name %> 
well-organized and accessible to all users.</p>

<p class='section'><strong>General tagging guidelines</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tags should always be in lowercase and use underscores instead of spaces.</strong> 
Only add relevant and clearly identifiable tags to avoid clutter.</p>

<p>If an artwork includes characters from franchises other than Yume Nikki and/or 
fangames, it should be tagged with <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/crossover">crossover</a> 
along with the relevant copyright tags. <strong>Artworks with multiple characters 
from Yume Nikki and fangames shown together are not considered crossovers and 
should not be tagged as such.<strong></p>

<p>Imitations of another work (for example, one character depicted as another) should 
be tagged as <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/parody">parody</a>. Copyright tags 
must be applied for both original franchise and the one being parodied.</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/animated_gif">animated_gif</a> for animated 
images and <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/video">video</a> for, well, videos. 
Images below 500x500 pixels must be tagged <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/lowres">lowres</a>, 
while those exceeding 1500 pixels on one side should be tagged with 
<a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/highres">highres</a>.</p>

<p>If original source of the image was deleted, add <strong>bad_website_id</strong> tag, 
where "website" part is the website where the image was taken from. For Pixiv it&rsquo;s 
going to be <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/bad_pixiv_id">bad_pixiv_id</a>, for 
example. For Twitter, aka X - <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/bad_twitter_id">bad_twitter_id</a>, 
and so on.</p>

<p>If an image contains non-English text - translate it and add your translation 
by using notes when you edit the post. Add <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/translated">translated</a> 
tag if you have everything translated, otherwise - <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/partially_translated">partially_translated</a>. 
Unsure if your translation is correct? Add <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/check_translation">check_translation</a> 
tag, so someone else can review your translation. Don&rsquo;t know how to translate at 
all? Tag the post with <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/translation_request">translation_request</a> 
to, well request a translation.</p>

<p class='section'><strong>Artists</strong></p>

<p>Whenever possible, tag the original artist of the artwork. When an artist has an 
online presence, use the name they most commonly go by. This is usually done by 
adding their username on the platform you&rsquo;re uploading from to the tags list. If 
the artist&rsquo;s name is in Japanese, use Hepburn romanization and format it in the 
Western order unless the artist specifies otherwise. If the name is only available 
in kanji or hiragana, check for an official romanization before applying a standard one. 
Websites such as <a href="https://tangorin.com/">Tangorin</a> and <a href="https://www.romajidesu.com/">Romajidesu</a> 
can assist in properly romanizing Japanese names. For example, if an artist known 
as "しずく" has no official romanization, they should be tagged as <strong>shizuku</strong>. 
If the artist is unknown, tag the image with <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/artist_request">artist_request</a>.</p>

<p class='section'><strong>Characters</strong></p>

<p>Characters should be tagged using their most commonly recognized name. If multiple 
characters appear in an image, tag each one separately. For example, if an image 
clearly depicts Madotsuki, the correct tag would be <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/madotsuki">madotsuki</a>. 
When a character&rsquo;s identity is unknown for you, use 
<a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/character_request">character_request</a> tag.</p>

<p class='section'><strong>Copyrights</strong></p>

<p>The source material from which the character or setting originates should 
be tagged appropriately. If multiple works are referenced within a single image, 
include each relevant tag to ensure accurate categorization. For instance, an 
image featuring elements from Yume 2kki should be tagged with <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/yume_2kki">yume_2kki</a>. 
If the source of an artwork is unclear, <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/copyright_request">copyright_request</a> 
should be added instead.</p>

<p class='section'><strong>Effects</strong></p>

<p>Effects that characters are using should be tagged, whether they involve 
specific items, transformations, or visual changes. If multiple effects are 
present, tag each one separately. For example, if Madotsuki riding a bicycle, 
add <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/bicycle_effect">bicycle_effect</a>. If the 
character&rsquo;s appearance is different from the usual, and you are unsure 
if the character portrayed using an effect or not, add <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/effect_request">effect_request</a> 
tag. Or look the character up on Yume Nikki Fangames Wiki and try to find details 
that both in-game sprite and artwork have in common.</p>

<p class='section'><strong>Locations</strong></p>

<p>If an artwork depicts a recognizable location from Yume Nikki or fangame, it 
should be tagged with it&rsquo;s specific, most commonly known name. For example, 
if an image features the Nexus, it should be tagged as <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/nexus">nexus</a>. 
When an exact location is uncertain, use <a href="https://yumeboo.ru/tag/location_request">location_request</a> instead.</p>
