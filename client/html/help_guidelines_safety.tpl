<p>Ratings are used to categorize content on <%- ctx.name %>.

Nothing sexualized or inappropriate to view in front of others.</li>
        <li><strong>Sketchy</strong> - Ecchi, suggestive, or mildly 
erotic. Skimpy or revealing clothes, swimsuits, underwear, images 
focused on breasts or ass, as well as mildly graphic gore, and 
anything potentially not safe for work.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsafe</strong> - Simple nudity or near-nudity, 
graphic gore and violence.</li>
    </ul>
