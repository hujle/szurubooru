<p class='section'><strong>Take down my artwork!</strong></p>

<p>If you believe that your artwork has been used or distributed without 
your authorization, you may submit a takedown request. Allow up to 72 hours 
for your request to be processed. You may not receive a response, unless 
further information is needed from you.</p>

<p>We will not remove any information other than artwork itself. This 
information include artist tags, links to social media profiles or other 
websites or links to artworks on other websites.</p>

<p>We will not remove artwork from <%- ctx.name %> if the original post on your social 
media profiles or websites was deleted. Re-uploading deleted artwork and submitting 
it in takedown request will not work.</p>

<p>We will make previously taken down artwork publicly available again if we find out 
that original source of artwork was deleted.</p>

<p>The following information is required to process your takedown request. 
Please submit your information in English.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Your contact information. Include your username, links to social 
media, and e-mail address.</li>
    <li>Confirmation of ownership. Create a post on any of your social media 
about sending takedown request to <%- ctx.name %>, and attach the post link 
to your takedown request. This is necessary to avoid third-party acting on 
behalf of another person.</li>
    <li>A list of links to each post on <%- ctx.name %> you wish to have removed. 
Screenshots or simply listing your artist tag, artist name or social media accounts 
are not sufficient to locate the exact posts you wish to have removed.</li>
    <li>For each <%- ctx.name %> post, provide a link to original post on your 
Pixiv, Twitter, other social media accounts or websites.</li>
    <li>A statement of good faith.</li>
    <li>A statement of accuracy.</li>
    <li>(Optional) A statement where you express your wish to not see any of your 
future works on <%- ctx.name %>.</li>
    <li>Your signature. Typing your pseudonym or artist handle will suffice.</li>
</ol>

<p>Upon receiving a valid request, we will take appropriate action, which may include 
removing or restricting access to the content.</p>
